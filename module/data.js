Ports of the arcade games and original The King of Fighters games have been released for the Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket, Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, N-Gage, Sega Saturn and Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation and PlayStation 2, PC, and Xbox. One of the most recent games in the series are KOF: Maximum Impact series. \n The initial storyline follows Kyo Kusanagi, a young Japanese who enters The King of Fighters tournaments. Being the heir of the ancient Kusanagi clan, who wield pyrokinetic powers, Kyo manages to use its powerful techniques to become champion of the tournament along with his friends. Kyo and his friends find themsleves meeting the host of the events: a powerful criminal named Rugal Bernstein, who wants to find worthy opponents to kill so that he can turn them into statues in order to remember his ruthless victories but is defeated. In the 1995 KOF tournament, it is revealed the entity of Orochi: an ancient eight-headed demon who was sealed by the three ancient artifacts of Japan. Rugal tries to use it but dies in the process. In this game, a fighter named Iori Yagami appears aiming to kill Kyo and destroy the Kusanagi clan, as revenge for the Yagami clan. \n The King of Fighters '95 is a 1995 fighting game produced by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home console. It is the sequel to The King of Fighters '94 and the second game in The King of Fighters series. It is also the first game in the series to be ported to other home consoles besides the Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD, with versions released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Game Boy. \n The King of Fighters '95 marks the beginning of a story arc that later became known as the \"Orochi Saga\". However, the only elements from the Orochi saga known in this game are the introduction of Kyo's rival, Iori Yagami, and Rugal's use of the Orochi power. \n Rugal Bernstein, thought to have perished in an explosion in the previous game, had in fact survived and sent out invitations to the teams from the previous game signed simply 'R'. Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new tournament, the American Sports team, now replaced by the \"Rival Team\" consisting of Iori Yagami, Billy Kane (from the Fatal Fury), and Eiji Kisaragi (from Art of Fighting 2). \n The Playstation version features an Art Gallery with illustration gallery, unused art and a secret ending demo unlockble, this version is also vibration function compatible.

It is the third game in The King of Fighters series, following The King of Fighters '95. Like its predecessor, the game was ported to the Neo-Geo CD, as well as the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Unlike the previous game, the PlayStation and Saturn versions were released only in Japan, with a language setting allowing the player to set the game to English. It is also part of the compilation The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii. It was also released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on February 15, 2011. \n   The King of Fighters '96 has 27 regular characters plus 2 boss characters (who can be unlocked with the use of a code). Newcomers to the tournament include Mr. Big from the Art of Fighting series, the bosses from Fatal Fury (Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard), and completely original characters like Leona Heidern, Mature and Vice. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default \"Team Fighting\" mode or the traditional \"Single Fighter\" style of gameplay, plus the \"Versus\" and \"Survival\" gameplay modes. \n   GAMEPLAY: \n   KOF '96 made a few slight changes to the gameplay of previous KOF games by introducing new techniques. The Dodge technique from the previous two game is replaced by an \"emergency evasion\" or \"attack deflector\" technique, which allows the player's character to roll away or towards the opponent. In the latter case, the player can have the ability to roll towards the opponent and end up at the other side. \n   The player can also determine the height of their jump and perform small or high jumps. Additionally, the graphics for all the character sprites from the previous games were redrawn and the commands for certain Special and Super moves were changed from previous games. \n   Like in the previous, Super Special Moves can be performed when the Power Gauge is filled up or when the player's life gauge is flashing red. However, the player can also perform a more powerful version of their regular Super move if both conditions are met (the player has low energy and Maximum level power gauge). \n   STORY: \n   A new King of Fighters tournament was announced, though the letters of invitation sent out to the fighters were no longer sent by Rugal Bernstein. The letters also announced many changes, the first of which being a massive overhaul of the tournament's approach. During the time that had passed between the tournaments since the previous year, the King of Fighters tournament's fame had grown immensely, to the point that it turned into a major international event, which had not happened before. \n   Huge corporations transformed the King of Fighters tournament into something widely televised, commercialized, and celebrated, drawing in many crowds from around the world. The tournament is now held by Chizuru Kagura, a descendant of the ancient Yata Clan responsible for sealing the Orochi demon along with the Kusanagi and Yasanaki clans (the clans from Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, respectively). Chizuru uses the tournament in hopes of finding and recruiting Kyo and Iori in order to stop the upcoming Orochi threat, but Kyo and Iori aren't exactly willing to work together on friendly terms. \n   CHARACTERS: \n   The character roster underwent major changes since the previous game. The Rival Team was disbanded, with only Iori Yagami returning, while Heidern and Takuma Sakazaki retired from the tournament. Takuma's spot in the Art of Fighting Team was taken by his daughter Yuri Sakazaki, formerly with the Women Fighters Team. \n   New characters introduced in this episode include Kasumi Todoh from Art of Fighting 3, who takes Yuri's place in the Women Fighters Team; Leona, who joins the Ikari Team in place of her mentor and adoptive father, Heidern; Mature and Vice, two of Rugal's assistants who join Iori Yagami as members of the new Yagami Team; and the Boss Team, composed of Geese Howard, Wolfgang Krauser, and Mr. Big, all villains from the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting series. The new boss character is Goenitz, a servant from Orochi who wants to stop Chizuru's plans of sealing his master. By Galisteo Games©",

Extra Mode is the typical AOF/KOF scheme, in which your power gauge fills up as you defend yourself or charge yourself up. The new Advanced Mode, on the other hand, only allows you to charge your gauge as you perform special moves and attacks, similar to the Street Fighter series. Extra allows one to sidestep attacks while Advanced allows the character to roll past and dodge attacks; Advanced also allow a character to perform a potent \"Super Desperation Move\" (or SDM) at any time provided the character has at least two full bars of charged energy stored. In contrast, SDMs can only be performed in Extra when a character has less than a quarter of their health left. \n   New characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of \"Blue\" Mary Ryan and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo's pupil Shingo Yabuki. In total, The King of Fighters '97 sports 29 separate characters (without counting the six Orochi-related boss characters, which are all accessible via a secret code). \n   The Playstation version features 2 artwork gallery & unlocklable demo mode that is sort of a movie in which all the sequences of the team in which the player completed the game can be watched.

Kyo and his friends find themsleves meeting the host of the events: a powerful criminal named Rugal Bernstein, who wants to find worthy opponents to kill so that he can turn them into statues in order to remember his ruthless victories but is defeated. In the 1995 KOF tournament, it is revealed the entity of Orochi: an ancient eight-headed demon who was sealed by the three ancient artifacts of Japan. Rugal tries to use it but dies in the process. In this game, a fighter named Iori Yagami appears aiming to kill Kyo and destroy the Kusanagi clan, as revenge for the Yagami clan. \n   In 1996, a new tournament is organized by the heir of the Yata clan, Chizuru Kagura, who wants to gather Kyo and Iori in her team to seal the Orochi demon, as their clans had done in the past.

Kyo and Iori decide to join Chizuru to stop them and although they succeed in defeating them, Orochi is able to revive through the use of his Heralds' sacrifices. Joining their forces, Kyo, Iori, and Chizuru defeat and seal Orochi once again, however Kyo and Iori disappear during the aftermath of the battle. \n   The King of Fighters '98 was released on July 23, 1998 and unlike previous games it did not feature a story; instead, the game allows players to play with most of characters available on previous ones, including ones that were supposedly dead. SNK refitted the Sega Dreamcast version renaming it The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999 with an extended cel animated introduction and 3D backgrounds.

It is the sixth installment in the company's The King of Fighters series. The game was ported to the Neo-Geo CD and the PlayStation as the final KOF game released for both platforms. A Dreamcast version was also released under the title The King of Fighters '99 Evolution in which the stages look exactly the same as compared with the arcade counterpart only to be exclusively, remodeled into 3D rendered. Both the Neo Geo and Dreamcast versions are included in The Kings of Fighters NESTS Hen compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. The game introduces several changes to the established KOF format, as well as a new story arc that would later be dubbed the \"NESTS Chronicles\". \n PLOT: \n Two years have passed since the last King of Fighters tournament and nobody has seen Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami since they defeated Orochi at the climax of the 1997 tournament, but out of the blue, new invitations are sent out to many characters, inviting them to a brand new tournament, though this competition is more of a secretive affair than the ones in '96 and '97. Unlike in previous games of the series, there are four characters per team instead of three. In total, there are seven teams, each containing four characters, four Team Edit characters and a boss. \n PLAYSTATION VERSION: \n The 1999 edition of the The King of Fighters series made the rounds from the arcade to the Neo Geo and Dreamcast before finding its way to the PlayStation console with this release. Players choose a team of three warriors and take on all challengers in this classically styled 2D fighter from the veterans at Agetec and SNK. \n Though based heavily on earlier versions of The King of Fighters '99, this PlayStation game adds new features designed to especially appeal to fans of the series, such as voice and picture galleries and a color edit mode that allows players to change the appearance of their favorite characters. \n Features: \n The King of Fighters '99 adds one new character to the roster of 32 \n New to the series are Striker Matches where characters jump into matches to save teammates \n Gallery mode features a variety of artwork, demo animations and voice samples By Galisteo Games©",

He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.\n\nCombat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.\n\nMissions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.\n\nThere are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.

Though this third version of the title is being released on half a dozen platforms and considerable effort has been invested in assuring that the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of the live up to their \"next-generation\" technological potential, Neversoft and Activision endeavored to bless this PS version with all of the third edition's key innovations while retaining and reinforcing the engaging, accessible gameplay which is the true crux of the series' success. \n \nWhile it can't pump out the same amount of eye-candy as its counterparts on the 128-bit generation systems, this PlayStation release of THPS3 incorporates several of the new features designed to propel the series' popularity on other platforms. New landing tricks allow players to string together greater combinations, especially when moving from the ramps to the street. Environments are designed to test old and new skills alike. Loyal PS gamers should be pleased that all the important new levels, tricks, and combinations developed for the third edition of Tony Hawk Pro Skater are duly represented in this version of the game.
